## Project Description
This Accessible Voting Platform is built for the purpose of Alexis Vu's independent project for the
CS 6150 - Computing For Good course.

## Project Goals
This platform is aimed at providing a source of information for US citizens with disabilities to have
increased access to voting-related information. In doing this, I hope to streamline and ease the voting
process for these individuals and ensure they have a full and equal opportunity to participate in their
civic right.
