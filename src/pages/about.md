## Project Description
This Accessible Voting Platform is built for the purpose of Alexis Vu's independent project for the
CS 6150 - Computing For Good course. 

## Project Goals
This platform is aimed at providing a source of information for US citizens with disabilities to have
increased access to voting-related information. In doing this, I hope to streamline and ease the voting
process for these individuals and ensure they have a full and equal opportunity to participate in their
civic right.

## Project Notes
This project integrates a [Voting Information Tool](https://all.votinginfotool.org/) widget powered by Google's Civic Information API. 
As the upcoming election approaches, more information will be added. Currently, searching from some addresses whose information is not
yet populated within Google's API may not produce results. <br>

In the meantime, you may use this address to see how results are displayed: 4121 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA, USA.
